# Committed To Completing JavaScript30 Challenges
There will be a total of 30 challenges that will be completed in the coming future. In each of these challenges, additions and/or improvement will be made at my own efforts. A detail explanation of the original intend for each project along with it's improvements will be provided for my own understanding if any. This will serve as my notes to improve my own understanding and hopefully help future readers or employers to understand my thought process.
